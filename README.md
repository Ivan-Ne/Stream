# Stream
In this task I created a list with 10000 numbers of int type  from 100 to 200.
Then by the converting this list to a stream and using methods filter, map and collect I got the list with new numbers.
This is very useful to use a stream if I need to do any actions with numbers from the list.
Open the folder Main to see the code.
